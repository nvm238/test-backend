## Description

Briefly describe the features implemented by this MR, e.g.

*All cards now open a ride details page, as long as there is an intent for the card (this can be seen in the Zeplin designs).*

**Notes for code reviewer**

Please let me know if you cannot complete this MR by midday tomorrow so I can re-assign it if necessary.

For guidelines, please see the [Code Review Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P2JqwyGssxef3_85-jVLhqeM_-gReLQQfR89fJ3gzAA/edit?usp=sharing).

Any extra information that will help with the code review, e.g.

- Why did you choose this implementation?
- Any known issues?
- Are there any outstanding TO-DO: messages to be dealt with in a later commit?
- Any areas of the code you would like given special attention? (NOTE: Please use code blocks (three back-ticks with language name) for quoted code for readability)
- Any dependent merge requests which should be merged first? (NOTE: You can reference these using `!<MR-id>`)

## JIRA Issue(s)

* Fixed: https://innovattic.atlassian.net/browse/TOOGH-99
* Related: https://innovattic.atlassian.net/browse/TOOGH-100

## Testing details

Autotests

- Is the code tested by unit/integration tests?

Manual testing

- Is the code manually tested / does it require testing by the reviewer?

Testing notes: (e.g. *Do you need an account? How do you reach the code that's been changed?*)

## Impact

* Deployment: (For example) nginx will reload config. User perceived impact: none.
* Rollback: automatic on deployment of previous version.

## Documentation

Do the changes need to be documented anywhere?

## Security/privacy

Are there any changes that influence the security/privacy of the software? For example, is there additional personal
data stored and/or processed?

If so, document what has changed in the security document (docs/security.md) and inform the Security / Privacy officer if necessary (when something has changed w.r.t. personal data storage for example).
